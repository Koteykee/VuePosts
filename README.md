# This simple posts app is my first Vue3 project where i learned how to:

1. Use axios to send requests to an API.
2. Use Pinia to store and synchronize the search state (searchQuery) across components.
3. Structure and reuse components in Vue3.
4. Use Suspense for handling asynchronous component loading.

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
